(*)Clients that are in noclip mode can pass through CORDON and the area that kills you if you enter it without being killed.
(*)Noclip mode can be toggled even if you're a ghost. Truly, the future is now.

(*)Added a new bioeffect "stability_maximizer" that gives a stability loss of -99999. Use this if you give someone a bunch of dumb superpowers and don't want them to turn into a puddle of gibs or whatever (at least until there's a way to add stabilized/empowered/whatever-the-fuck effects)

(*)New toggle "Toggle Flying Chat". It makes chat show up above people's heads. Novel, I guess.

(*)Adds a little animation to the admin jump command when used normally. Yell at me if you hate it, I'll be moving it to replace the theatrical jump if you don't after a bit.

(*)<tt>dsay</tt> will now broadcast to the same people as normal dead chat, probably

(*)<strong>The notes, logs, and stats links in the player panel are in the top right.</strong>
(*)Fixed a bug where the notes link wouldn't appear when a client was logged out, even if there was a ckey on the mob.

(*)Coders can now view and edit all global variables..for the most part.
(*)This is SLOW, SLUGGISH, and UNFAST!! Turns out there's far too many globals, blame MBC and whoever created the couches list.

(*)Moved everything older than a few months to admin_changelog_old.txt because this was getting so big it was causing client crashes. lmao

(*)SAs now get Heal and Get commands on the player panel. Seems like you should have access to those.

(*)Player Panel overhauled. It's rearranged, totally different, and sucks.
(*)"Notes" and "Logs" are in the top right, since they're the most useful.
(*)"Polymorph" is now just "Edit Appearance".
(*)"Transform" was removed. Mutant races are under "Edit Appearance", AI/Cyborg/Ghostdrone are now their own things.
(*)Clicking "Logs" on a mob with no ckey will search for the mob's name instead of prompting you for something.
(*)Quick info on health and location are now shown.
(*)You can now gib people by imploding them.
(*)You can cancel out if you accidentally click "Send to". The future is now.
(*)Some shit probably got broken so let me know if you run into something that is, in fact, broken.
(*)Player Mode now toggles popup verbs off (if they're on).
(*)Blob speak respects see-deadchat / player mode options (hopefully)

(*)"Respawn As" will no longer announce you as a late join.
(*)"Respawn As Self" should no longer warn you about mob deletion if you're an observer.
(*)"Remove Self" should no longer produce a deathgasp, or any other weird things. It just ghosts you immediately.

(*)You can now ban players from an individual server, or all servers. The way this is coded is a terrible no good hack that only has to work long enough for the ban refactor to arrive (one day...).

(*)In the Lag Reductions panel, admins can now adjust the upper/lower bounds that ticklag dilation will clamp to.

(*)say verb now logs the location of the speaker.
(*) Searching logs in-game in the game-panel now uses Regular Expressions instead of just strings. Shouldn't bother people unfamiliar with em too much. This is a useful site to get a handle on what they are if you want to look: https://www.regular-expressions.info/

(*)New verb in debug command tab: "View Global Variable". Supply a string with the global variable's name and it retireves that reference from global.vars for viewing in a menu like the view variables screen.
